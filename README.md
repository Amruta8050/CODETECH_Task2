## 🧪 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas  
2. Identified missing values using `isnull()`  
3. Visualized missing data using bar charts  
4. Filled numerical missing values using **median**  
5. Filled categorical missing values using **mode**  
6. Removed columns with more than 40% missing values  
7. Verified dataset after cleaning  
8. Saved the cleaned dataset to a CSV file

## ✅ Final Outcome
- All missing values were successfully handled  
- Dataset quality was improved  
- Cleaned dataset is ready for machine learning models
